# vibe-coding-prompts

### 撰写方案：
I would like to modify the project according to the following method. Please write a detailed, step-by-step, executable code modification plan for the project:

### 修改方案：
Please evaluate, analyze, and critique the following rough plan, and roughly assess its feasibility. 【do not modify any files or code】

The basic structure of the current project is 
- Training: Input 【】 → Output 【】;
- Test: Input 【】 → Output 【】.

Aim to change this project (preliminary) to 
- Training: Input 【】 → Output 【】;
- Test: Input 【】 → Output 【】.

Please refine and improve the following rough change plan for this project:

1.1

1.2

...

### 实现方案：
In this comprehensive task, you need to modify the project code (for the total goal: Transition the existing single-image perception pipeline to a multi-sensor (Camera + LiDAR) Bird's-Eye View (BEV) fusion architecture. This involves generating multiple BEV "panels" as image inputs for the Qwen2-VL model to improve 3D object detection accuracy, while minimizing changes to the existing training and evaluation logic) in 7 phases (1 to 7). 

The Phase 1 (【】) and Phase 2 (【】) has been done. 

The following text is the plan for Phase 3:

(Except this project, you may also use and modify the files in 【】 and 【】)

(【】 is in the folder 【】)

(【】 is in the folder 【】)

【DO NOT RUN 【train】 or 【evaluation】! This machine is not a server and is not suitable for running deep learning programs, so it cannot execute training, prediction, and evaluation.】

Phase 3 (【】):
...

### 修bug：
According to the following plan, resolve the problem in 【log】

【DO NOT RUN 【train】 or 【evaluation】! This machine is not a server and is not suitable for running deep learning programs, so it cannot execute training, prediction, and evaluation.】
